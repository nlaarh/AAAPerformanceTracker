# AAAPerformanceTracker

## Overview

The AAAPerformanceTracker is a Flask-based web application designed for executive performance evaluation, specifically targeting all officer assessments by board members and administrators. The system provides role-based access control, structured performance evaluations across multiple categories, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design preference: Modern Apple/React-style interfaces with light, clean aesthetics instead of dark themes. Single navbar design with inspiring high-quality logo on left and app name - no dual banners. Navigation items positioned in center of navbar. Use very light, subtle colors that are easy on eyes with readable fonts, avoid strong colors like blue, yellow, or green.
Form preferences: Clean, simplified evaluation forms with minimal input fields - no duplicate comment sections per question.
Matrix preferences: Simple 2D matrix with questions in rows, reviewers in columns, single score per question, short category descriptions (Finance, Strategy, Operations, Culture, External).
**Data Management**: Always create database backups before making large data changes or deletions. Use pg_dump to backup PostgreSQL database with timestamp naming convention.
**CRITICAL WARNING**: The matrix display logic in officer_reviews function is WORKING CORRECTLY and must NEVER be modified. It includes the critical fix for self-assessment display. Only modify export functions, never the core matrix logic.
