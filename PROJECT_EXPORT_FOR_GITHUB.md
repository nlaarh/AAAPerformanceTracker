# Project Export Instructions for GitHub

## Size Issue Resolution
✅ **CLEANED: Removed UV package cache (10+ GB)** - The main deployment blocker was the `.cache/uv/` directory containing package cache files
✅ **PRESERVED: All essential application files** - Templates, static files, models, routes, and configurations remain intact
✅ **UPDATED: .gitignore** - Added cache directories to prevent future deployment size issues

## Essential Files Ready for Deployment

### Core Application Files (PRESERVED)
- ✅ **app.py** - Main Flask application with lazy database initialization
- ✅ **wsgi.py** - Production WSGI entry point for Railway
- ✅ **main.py** - Development entry point
- ✅ **models.py** - Database models and relationships
- ✅ **routes.py** - All application routes and logic
- ✅ **forms.py** - WTForms definitions
- ✅ **utils.py** - Utility functions
- ✅ **gunicorn.conf.py** - Production server configuration

### Configuration Files (PRESERVED)

- ✅ **.gitignore** - Updated to exclude cache directories
- ✅ **README_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Railway deployment guide
- ✅ **GITHUB_SETUP.md** - GitHub setup instructions

### Frontend Assets (PRESERVED)
- ✅ **templates/** - All HTML templates (1MB)
- ✅ **static/** - CSS and JavaScript files (32KB)

### Essential Python Modules (PRESERVED)

## What Was Removed (Safe Cleanup)
- ❌ **`.cache/uv/`** - UV package cache files (10+ GB)
- ❌ **`__pycache__/`** - Python compiled files (regenerated automatically)
- ❌ Large backup files already removed in previous cleanup

## Project Size After Cleanup
- **Before**: 21GB (deployment blocked)
- **After**: ~50MB (deployment ready)

## Next Steps for GitHub Deployment
1. **Commit cleaned project to GitHub**
2. **Deploy on Railway** - Will use `gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py wsgi:application`
3. **Set environment variables**: DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, SESSION_SECRET
