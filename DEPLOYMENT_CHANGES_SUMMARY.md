# Text Alignment Fix - Deployment Summary
## Date: July 18, 2025

### Issue Fixed
- Assessment response text was displaying left-aligned initially but centering after page refresh
- Bootstrap CSS was overriding inline styles causing inconsistent text alignment

### Root Cause
- Bootstrap form-control classes were applying center alignment
- CSS loading order was causing styles to be overridden after page load

### Solution Implemented

#### Files Modified:

1. **templates/view_all_officer_reviews.html**
   - Lines 289, 292, 301, 306: Replaced all Bootstrap classes with simple inline styles
   - Used direct `style="text-align: left; padding: 12px; background: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #dee2e6; border-radius: 6px;"`
   - Removed form-control-plaintext classes that were causing centering

2. **static/css/modern.css**
   - Lines 545-551: Added backup CSS rules to prevent future alignment issues
   - Added specific selectors for text response containers

3. **replit.md**
   - Updated Recent Changes section with fix documentation
   - Documented solution approach and verification

### Verification
- Text responses (ACCOMPLISHMENTS, FOCUS, IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES) now display with consistent left alignment
- No more flickering from left to center after page refresh
- Simple inline styles cannot be overridden by Bootstrap

### Technical Details
- Removed complex CSS class dependencies
- Used direct HTML styling approach
- Added fallback CSS rules in main stylesheet
- Simplified template structure for better maintainability

### Status: COMPLETED AND VERIFIED WORKING
All assessment response text now displays with proper left alignment consistently.
