# WORKING MATRIX BACKUP - July 14, 2025

## TAG: FULLY_WORKING_MATRIX_V1

This backup represents the FULLY WORKING version of the matrix display system with:

### ‚úÖ WORKING FEATURES:
1. **Self-Assessment Display**: Self-assessment scores correctly display in matrix blue boxes
2. **Question Text Matching**: Maps equivalent questions across different form types (reviewer vs self-review)
3. **Form Type Integration**: Includes both 'reviewer' and 'self_review' forms from PeriodFormAssignment
4. **Rating-Only Matrix**: Filters out text-only questions (signatures, comments, dates)
5. **Correct Calculation Logic**: Self-assessment scores display but are excluded from reviewer averages
6. **360-Degree Review**: Full functionality with proper external reviewer vs self-assessment distinction

### üîß KEY TECHNICAL FIXES:
- Matrix query includes both form_type='reviewer' AND form_type='self_review'
- Question text matching prevents duplicate rows
- question.question_type == 'rating' filter for clean matrix
- reviewer.id != officer.id exclusion in average calculations
- Proper response mapping across different form IDs

- models_working_matrix_backup.py (database models)
- main_working_matrix_backup.py (application entry)
