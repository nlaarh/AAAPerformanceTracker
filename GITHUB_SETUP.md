# GitHub Setup Instructions for Railway Deployment

## Current Status
✅ Local git repository exists with recent deployment fixes committed
✅ All deployment timeout issues resolved
✅ Health check endpoint working
✅ Production-ready configuration complete

## Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository named `AAAPerformanceTracker`

### 2. Add Remote and Push
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AAAPerformanceTracker.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deploy on Railway
1. Go to Railway.app
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `AAAPerformanceTracker` repository
5. Railway will automatically detect it as a Python project

### 4. Configure Environment Variables in Railway
Add these environment variables in Railway dashboard:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Your PostgreSQL database
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...         # Your OpenAI API key  
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key
```
